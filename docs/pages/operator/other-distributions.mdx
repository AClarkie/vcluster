By default, vcluster will use [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) as virtual Kubernetes cluster, which is a highly available, certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads in unattended, resource-constrained, remote locations or inside IoT appliances.

However, vcluster also works with other Kubernetes distributions and k3s is not required. We recommend to use k3s, because it has a small footprint and widely adopted, but if your use case requires a different k8s distribution, vcluster also supports k0s or vanilla k8s.

## k0s

[k0s](https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s) is an all-inclusive Kubernetes distribution, which is configured with all of the features needed to build a Kubernetes cluster and packaged as a single binary for ease of use. vcluster supports k0s as backing virtual Kubernetes cluster.

In order to use k0s as backing cluster, create a vcluster with the following command:

```
vcluster create vcluster-1 -n host-namespace-1 --distro k0s
```

Connect to the vcluster and start using it:
```
vcluster connect vcluster-1 -n host-namespace-1

# Then execute in a new terminal
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get ns
...
```

Behind the scenes a different helm chart will be deployed (`vcluster-k0s`), that holds specific configuration to support k0s. Check the [github repository](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/tree/main/charts/k0s) for all available chart options.

## Vanilla k8s

When choosing this option, vcluster will deploy a separate etcd cluster, kubernetes controller manager and api server alongside the vcluster hypervisor. 

In order to use vanilla k8s as backing cluster, create a vcluster with the following command:

```
vcluster create vcluster-1 -n host-namespace-1 --distro k8s
```

Connect to the vcluster and start using it:
```
vcluster connect vcluster-1 -n host-namespace-1

# Then execute in a new terminal
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get ns
...
```

Behind the scenes a different helm chart will be deployed (`vcluster-k8s`), that holds specific configuration to support vanilla k8s. Check the [github repository](https://github.com/loft-sh/vcluster/tree/main/charts/k8s) for all available chart options.

### High Available Vanilla k8s

In order to run vcluster in high availability mode, create a `values.yaml` in the following form:

```
# Enable HA mode
enableHA: true

# Scale up syncer replicas
syncer:
  replicas: 3

# Scale up etcd
etcd:
  replicas: 3

# Scale up controller manager
controller:
  replicas: 3

# Scale up api server
api:
  replicas: 3
```

Then create the vcluster with the following command:
```
vcluster create ... --distro k8s -f values.yaml
```

Check that vcluster including the control plane are running correctly:
```
kubectl get po -n vcluster

```

Now connect to the vcluster:
```
vcluster connect vcluster-1 -n host-namespace-1

# Then execute in a new terminal
export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get ns
...
```
