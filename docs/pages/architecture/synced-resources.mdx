title: Synced Resources
sidebar_label: Synced Resources
---

This section lists all resources that can be synced or mirrored by vcluster currently in the table below. Those resources can be activated or deactivated via the `--sync` flag of the syncer. By default, certain resources are already activated and you can either disable the default resources or tell vcluster to sync other supported resources as well.

| volumesnapshots        | Enables volumesnapshot, volumesnapshotcontents and volumesnapshotclasses support. Syncing behaves similar to persistentvolumeclaims, persistentvolumes and storage classes.

By default, vcluster runs with a minimal set of RBAC permissions to allow execution in restricted environments. Certain resources require extra permissions:
1. **Cluster Role**: The cluster role can be enabled via the helm value `rbac.clusterRole.create: true`
2. **Extended Namespace Role**: The extended rules for the namespace role can be enabled via the helm value `rbac.role.extended: true`

E.g. to enable cluster role and extended namespace role, use the following `values.yaml`:

```
rbac:
  clusterRole: 
    create: true
  role:
    extended: true
```

then create or upgrade the vcluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

## Enable or disable synced resources

To disable a default synced resource, prefix the resource with `-`, so for example if you don't want to sync ingresses, specify this in the `--sync` flag like this: 

```yaml
syncer:
  extraArgs:
  - --sync=-ingresses # Disables ingress sync
```

If you also want to enable a non default synced resource, just add the resource name to the `--sync` flag like this:

```yaml
syncer:
  extraArgs:
  - --sync=priorityclasses,-ingresses # Enables priority classes sync and disables ingresses sync
```

:::warning Correct Cluster Functionality
Disabling certain resources such as services, endpoints or pods can lead to a non-functional virtual Kubernetes cluster, so be careful with what resources you are deactivating. 
::: 

## Sync other resources

Syncing other resources such as deployments, statefulsets and namespaces is usually not needed as those just control lower level resources and since those lower level resources are synced the cluster can function correctly. 

However, there might be cases though were custom syncing of resources might be needed or beneficial. In order to accomplish this, vcluster provides an SDK to develop your own resource syncers. This is currently a work in progress and will be added in the form of plugins to vcluster shortly (ETA February-March 2022).
