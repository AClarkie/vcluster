By default, certain Kubernetes objects such as Services or Ingresses are synced from the virtual cluster to the host cluster. The syncer translates problematic fields (such as pod labels) and also transforms certain fields of these objects before sending them to the host cluster, to ensure integrity of the virtual cluster.

If you need to use priority classes, you can enable this by adding the following to your `values.yaml`:
```
sync:
  priorityclasses:
    enabled: true
```
then create or upgrade the vcluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster -n my-vcluster-namespace --upgrade -f values.yaml
```
